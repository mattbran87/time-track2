# Time Tracker App

### Ideas being explored in this project
******
* HTML5 Session Storage and Local Storage
⋅⋅*Session Storage and Local Storage are browser based data storage utilities. Local Storage and Session Storage differ in the time that data is stored. Local Storage has no expiration time, Session Storage only stores data for as long as the page session.
* Flatfile storage
⋅⋅*The application stores all user data in a .json file. Data is queried using Lodash, FileSync, and LowDB.
* Electron.js framework
⋅⋅*The Electron framework uses web technologies to build desktop applications. My experience so far in desktop application development has been in Python using the Tkinter library. The Tkinter library is useful but does not provide a framework to make applications look like they were made in the 21st century.
* JS OOP
⋅⋅*I am learning more about OOP in JavaScript. With my PHP background, I am learning more about JavaScript classes and prototypical inheritance.

### Technologies Used
* Electron.js
* Node.js
* Bootstrap 4
* jQuery
* Lodash with LowDB
* Moment.js
* Animate.css
